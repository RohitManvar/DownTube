## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-downloader.git
cd youtube-downloader
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install FFmpeg:
   - **Windows**: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH
   - **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or equivalent for your distribution

## Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

3. Paste a YouTube URL in the input field and click "Fetch Video"

4. Select your desired video quality from the dropdown menu

5. Click "Download Now" to start the download

6. Track download progress on the progress page

7. Once complete, click "Download File" to save the file to your computer

## How It Works

1. The application uses yt-dlp to fetch video information and available formats
2. Users select their preferred quality option
3. The video is downloaded and processed in the background
4. Progress is tracked in real-time and displayed to the user
5. Files are saved to the user's Downloads folder by default

## Customization

You can modify the download directory by editing the `DOWNLOAD_DIR` variable in `app.py`:

```python
# Use a custom download directory
DOWNLOAD_DIR = "/path/to/your/preferred/directory"
```
